<h1>The Best Books According To Abdul-Jeleel</h1>

<h2>My top 3 books of all-time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Al-Qur'an</h3>
<p>It is a holy book and a guide for mankind through his walk of life<br />
   It contains rules to be followed step by step<br />
   It clearly speaks of men before us, our generation and those after us.<br />
   </p>

<h3>Hadith</h3>
<p>This is without doubt a book you will fall in love with if you read.<br />
   It explicitly explains the idioms and hidden facts in the Qur'an.<br />
   most especially these are the words and actions of a man with no literate background, Muhammad.<br />
   </p> 

<h3>Kitabul-Fiqh</h3>
<p>This is a book that defines the worship of the Almight Allah.<br />
   It explains the "How", "When", "Where" Allah SWT is worshiped.<br />
